# About the Renwick Lab

At the Renwick Lab, our goal is to advance our understanding of microRNAs in health and disease. To achieve this goal, we combine expertise in RNA molecular biology and biochemistry, biomedical computing, pathological evaluation of clinical samples, and disease modeling through a multidisciplinary approach. We aim to leverage gained knowledge of microRNA-mediated gene regulation to diagnose, understand, and treat diseases.

## Our Mission

We are committed to training the next generation of basic and clinician-scientists and take pride in the achievements of our trainees. Our successes are measured by incremental increases in grant funding, manuscript impact, and audience size when presenting nationally and internationally. Importantly, our research activities are aligned with the missions of the Queenâ€™s University Faculty of Health Sciences and the Kingston General Hospital Research Institute to create and advance knowledge for the benefit of our patients.
